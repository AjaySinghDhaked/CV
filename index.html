  <p>IDS is an extrapolative model used to detect network traffic as routine or attack. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) is a revolutionary paradigm

     separation, SDN provides us the opportunity to create a manageable and programmable network, allowing applications in the top plane to access
     physical devices via the controller.
