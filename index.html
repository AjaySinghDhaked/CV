  <p>IDS is an extrapolative model used to detect network traffic as routine or attack. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) is a revolutionary paradigm
     that isolates the control plane from the data plane, transforming the concept of a software-driven network. Through this data and control plane
     separation, SDN provides us the opportunity to create a manageable and programmable network, allowing applications in the top plane to access
     physical devices via the controller.
